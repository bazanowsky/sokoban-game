# Sokoban Game

First try with Godot game engine. Trying to create sokoban like game. Playing with animations, collisions, some basic game logic, level progression etc. 

### Play online
You can open the game here: https://bazanowsky.itch.io/blocks-game although currently due to [#70691](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/70691) it takes long time to run.
